# FIRST WEEK FOR NEWHABIT

Every habit can be pushed into this repository, but you should keep signing here to form it.

## STEPS

1. Touch a New File under the Root <code>./</code>

    > just like this one <code>./Tom/</code>

2. Add README.md under your File

    > <code>./Tom/README.md </code>

3. Write the habit you want to keep and then say something about it everyday in next week.
